# Product Overview

Microflow is a set of tools designed to make it easier to start prototyping for interactivity, specifically focused on bridging the gap between design tools and microcontroller hardware.

## Core Applications

### Microflow Studio
A desktop Electron application that provides a visual, flow-based interface for creating interactive prototypes with microcontrollers. It automatically flashes Firmata firmware to supported boards and enables real-time communication via MQTT.

### Microflow Hardware Bridge
A Figma plugin that connects Figma designs to Microflow Studio or any MQTT-compatible application, allowing designers to prototype with real hardware directly from their design environment.

### Documentation Site
A Next.js-based documentation website hosted at microflow.vercel.app that provides comprehensive guides and API documentation.
