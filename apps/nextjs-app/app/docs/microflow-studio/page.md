Microflow studio is nothing more than a _fancy_ wrapper around the [Johnny-Five](https://johnny-five.io/) platform.

Microflow studio should automatically detect your micro-controller and connect to it. If it doesn't, you can manually select the board from the settings menu.

## Supported micro-controller boards

While Johnny-Five supports a broad range of boards, as of right now Microflow studio support the following boards

- Arduino uno
- Arduino mega
- Arduino leonardo
- Arduino micro
- Arduino nano
- Arduino yun
