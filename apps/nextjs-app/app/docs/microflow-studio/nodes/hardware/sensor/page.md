If your particular sensor is not mentioned explicitly it could still be a functioning sensor in microflow.

For this you could add either a `Digital Sensor` or an `Analog Sensor` to your flow which will give you a digital or analog signal respectively.

## Digital Sensor

## Analog Sensor
Sensors can be used to measure a varierity of `analog` signals, this could be a:

- [Rotary Potentiometer](/docs/microflow-studio/nodes/hardware/potentiometer)
- [Linear Potentiometer](/docs/microflow-studio/nodes/hardware/potentiometer#2-channel-sliding-potentiometer)
- Flex Sensitive Resistor
- Pressure Sensitive Resistor
- [Force Sensitive Resistor](/docs/microflow-studio/nodes/hardware/force)
- [Hall Sensor](/docs/microflow-studio/nodes/hardware/hall)
- [Tilt Sensor](/docs/microflow-studio/nodes/hardware/tilt)
- [Photoresistor/Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)](/docs/microflow-studio/nodes/hardware/ldr)

...And many more.
