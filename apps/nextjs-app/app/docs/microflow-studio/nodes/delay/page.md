You might not always would like to act directly on an event, but rather wait for a certain amount of time before proceeding. This is where the `Delay` node comes in. It allows you to wait for a certain amount of time before proceeding with the next node.

`Debounce`ing the delay allows you to reset the delay time every time the input changes. This can be useful when you want to wait for a certain amount of time after the last input change.
