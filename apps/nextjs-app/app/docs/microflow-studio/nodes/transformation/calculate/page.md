The Calculate node lets you do math with numbers in your flow. You can add, subtract, multiply, or divide values.

**Examples:**
- Add two sensor readings together
- Multiply a sensor value by 2 to double it
- Subtract one number from another
- Divide a large number to make it smaller

This is useful when you need to combine values, scale them up or down, or perform any mathematical calculation as part of your flow.
