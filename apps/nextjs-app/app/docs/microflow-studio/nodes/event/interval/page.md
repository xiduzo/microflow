An Interval node automatically sends a signal at regular time intervals, like a timer or clock.

**Examples:**
- Send a signal every second to blink an LED
- Trigger an action every 5 minutes to check a sensor
- Create a repeating pattern that happens every 500 milliseconds

You can set how often the interval repeats (like every 1 second, every 5 seconds, etc.). This is useful for creating automatic, repeating behaviors in your flow without needing to press a button or trigger it manually each time.
