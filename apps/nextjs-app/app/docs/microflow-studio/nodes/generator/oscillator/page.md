An Oscillator node creates a repeating pattern of numbers that goes up and down in a wave-like pattern. Think of it like a wave in the ocean - it goes up, then down, then up again in a smooth, repeating cycle.

**Wave types:** You can choose different wave patterns:
- **Sine wave:** A smooth, curved wave (like ocean waves)
- **Square wave:** A sharp on/off pattern (like a blinking light)
- **Triangle wave:** A straight-line up and down pattern
- **Sawtooth wave:** A gradual rise with a sharp drop

**Examples:**
- Create a pulsing LED that smoothly fades in and out
- Generate a vibration pattern that varies in intensity
- Make a servo motor move back and forth smoothly
- Create any repeating pattern that goes up and down

You can control how fast the wave repeats (frequency), how big the wave is (amplitude), and where it starts (phase). This is useful for creating smooth, automatic animations or patterns.
