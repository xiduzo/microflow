title: Output nodes
---

Output nodes allow you to control hardware components and send data to external services. These nodes are the endpoints of your flow, where actions are performed based on the data flowing through your microflow.

Output nodes can control both digital (on/off) and analog (variable intensity) devices like LEDs, servos, relays, and piezo buzzers, as well as send data to external services like Figma.
