A logic gate is a way to make decisions based on two inputs. Think of it like a simple rule that checks two conditions and gives you a result.

For example, an AND gate is like saying "both things must be true" - like "it's daytime AND the lights are off" before turning on a light. An OR gate is like saying "either thing can be true" - like "if it's dark OR someone presses a button, turn on the light."

Gates take two different inputs and produce a single output based on their logic. Below is an overview of how the different gates work:
