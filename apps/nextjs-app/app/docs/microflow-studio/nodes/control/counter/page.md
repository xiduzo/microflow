The Counter node keeps track of how many times something happens. It's like a tally counter that goes up (or down) each time it receives a signal.

**Examples:**
- Count how many times a button has been pressed
- Track how many times a sensor detects something
- Keep a running total of events
- Count down from a number and trigger something when it reaches zero

You can increase the counter, decrease it, set it to a specific value, or reset it back to zero. This is useful for creating games, tracking usage, or triggering actions after a certain number of events.
