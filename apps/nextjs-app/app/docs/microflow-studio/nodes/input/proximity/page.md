Proximity sensors can read the distance to an object.

## Types of proximity sensors
There are different types of proximity sensors available. The most common types are:

### Pulse/PWM
_No pulse/PWM proximity sensors have been tested with `Microflow` yet._

### Analog
_No analog proximity sensors have been tested with `Microflow` yet._

### Infrared
