A button is a simple input device that you can press to interact with your project. When you press it, it completes an electrical circuit, and when you release it, the circuit opens.

**How it works:** Connect a button to your microcontroller, and when someone presses it, the button node sends a signal that you can use to trigger other actions in your flow - like turning on an LED, starting a motor, or triggering any other node.
