title: Input nodes
---

Input nodes allow you to read data from various sources like sensors, buttons, switches, and external services. These nodes are the starting points of your flow, providing data that can be processed and used by other nodes.

Input nodes can read both digital (on/off) and analog (continuous values) signals from hardware components, as well as receive data from external services like MQTT brokers.
