The Monitor node lets you see what's happening in your flow by displaying the values and data as they pass through. It's like a window into your flow that shows you numbers, graphs, or other visual information.

**Why use it:**
- **Debugging:** See what values your sensors are actually reading
- **Understanding:** Watch how data changes as it flows through your nodes
- **Learning:** Understand how your flow works by seeing the data in real-time
- **Testing:** Verify that your flow is working as expected

The Monitor node doesn't change your flow - it just shows you what's happening. You can see graphs, numbers, or other visual displays of the data flowing through your project. This is especially helpful when things aren't working as expected and you need to figure out why.
