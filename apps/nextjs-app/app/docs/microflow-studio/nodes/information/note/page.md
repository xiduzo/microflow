The Note node lets you add text notes and labels to your flow to help you remember what different parts do or to document your project.

**Uses:**
- Add reminders about what a section of your flow does
- Label complex parts of your project
- Document how your flow works for future reference
- Leave notes for yourself or others working on the project

Notes don't affect how your flow works - they're just for documentation and organization. They're especially useful for complex flows where you might forget what each part does later.
