title: Connecting
---

When you start the Microflow Hardware Bridge plugin in a Figma project, it automatically creates a special variable collection called `MHB` (which stands for "Microflow Hardware Bridge").

**Important:** Only variables that are inside this `MHB` collection will be connected to your hardware. Variables in other collections won't be linked.

**How to use it:**
1. Open the Microflow Hardware Bridge plugin in Figma
2. The plugin creates the `MHB` collection automatically
3. Create or move variables into this collection
4. These variables will now be available to connect with your hardware in Microflow Studio
