Bridge the gap between your microcontrollers and design tools. {% .lead %}

The Microflow Hardware Bridge lets you connect your physical projects (with sensors, buttons, LEDs, etc.) to your Figma designs. This means you can control colors, numbers, and text in your Figma designs using real hardware, or send data from your designs to your hardware.

**Getting started:** Install the [Figma plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1373258770799080545) to begin connecting your hardware to your Figma designs.
