# Microflow

A set of tools to make it easier to start prototyping for interactivity.

Microflow consists of 2 applications so far:

1. Microflow studio
2. Microflow hardware bridge (Figma plugin)

[See the documentation](https://microflow.vercel.app/docs)

## Microflow studio

A desktop application that allows you to create interactive prototypes using a visual, flow-based, interface.

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/xiduzo/microflow/releases) and get started.

## Microflow hardware bridge

Bridge the gap between your microcontrollers and design tools.

Microflow hardware bridge is a [Figma plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1373258770799080545) that allows you to connect your Figma designs to the Microflow studio application or any other application that supports MQTT.
