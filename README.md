# Microflow

A set of tools to make it easier to start prototyping for interactivity.

Microflow consists of 2 applications so far:

1. Microflow studio
2. Microflow hardware bridge (Figma plugin)

## Microflow studio

A desktop application that allows you to create interactive prototypes using a visual, flow-based, interface.

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/xiduzo/microflow/releases) and get started.


## Microflow hardware bridge

Bridge the gap between your micro-controllers and design tools.

Microflow hardware bridge is a Figma plugin that allows you to connect your Figma designs to the Microflow studio application or any other application that supports MQTT.
